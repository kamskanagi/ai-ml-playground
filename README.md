# AI/ML Playground

This repo contain a collection of machine learning and AI projects demonstrating modern approaches to computer vision, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), model fine-tuning, and speech processing.

## Projects

### 1. **Potato Disease Classification** 
Deep learning application for agricultural disease detection using convolutional neural networks.

### 2. **End-to-End Medical Chatbot** 
RAG-powered conversational AI for medical information with production safety features.


### 3. **Fine-tuning with Unsloth** 
Educational notebook demonstrating parameter efficient fine-tuning on free GPU resources.


### 4. **AI Transcription & Cleanup Tool** 
Full-stack audio transcription with LLM powered text refinement (most production ready).
